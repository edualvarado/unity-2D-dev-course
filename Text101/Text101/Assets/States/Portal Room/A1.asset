  storyText: 'You take out of your coat the repair kit that you usually carry on
    your travels through time. From it you take out what looks like a small vial
    with a blue glow inside, called by your partners as cumulus. You open the damaged
    collector in the portal, being ready to replace the element inside it.


    But
    you know that the portal needs some time to reestablish itself. However, they
    are getting closer. You have doubts, and barely have time.


    What should
    I do?


    1. Replace the time portal collector as fast as possible.

    2.
    To not risk by hiding behind a nearby platform close to the portal.'
