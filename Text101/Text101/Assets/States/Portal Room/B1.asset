  storyText: 'After changing the collector, you start the return sequence. Beautiful
    lights that are transformed into multi-colored refractions start to emerge in
    the contour of the portal.


    Behind you, through the passage to the portal
    room, four creatures emerge and are thrown quickly towards your back.


    What
    should I do?


    1. In a quick backward move, throw a light grenade at the
    beings and try to escape running away.

    2. Close your eyes, just as you were
    taught at the knight''s school during your training.'
