  storyText: 'You run behind a metal platform that was semi-destroyed by the attacks
    of the last few days in the area. Once you are behind, you wait patiently for
    a chance to get away from there.


    Suddenly, four of the creatures enter
    through the passage leading to the portal room. They do so by emitting a shrill,
    yet musical sound. You''ve been told about them, but you''ve never seen them
    in person. You prefer not to look, remembering the advises taught during training.
    Maybe calling for help would be reasonable.


    What should I do?


    1.
    Use your temporal communicator to call for help to the base.

    2. Keep waiting
    behind the platform.'
