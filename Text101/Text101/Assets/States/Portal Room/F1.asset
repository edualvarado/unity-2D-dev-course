  storyText: "The sound of a small rock falling next to you alerts the creatures.
    Although they don\xB4t have a good hearing, it is loud enough to alert them.
    They are coming directly to you.\r\n\r\nAmong your arsenal you have no ammunition,
    only a light grenade that could be used to distract them and run into the time-travel
    portal to fix it.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do?\r\n\r\n1. Throw the grenade and run
    as fast as possible to the portal, hoping to have enough time to repair it and
    travel away.\n2. Close your eyes, just as you were taught at the knight's school
    during your training."
