  storyText: 'You close your eyes. You do not see or feel anything, only an odourless
    and warm breath on your face, besides their presence, as if they exert a  constant
    and mystical pressure on your body. They are there, close to you, being nothing
    that you felt before.


    Gradually, you notice how the pressure starts to
    fade, slowly and calmly. You believe that they are getting away.


    What should
    I do?


    1. Open your eyes and go to fix the portal. The creatures seem to
    be gone and there is no time to lose.

    2. Keep waiting with your eyes closed
    a little bit more.'
