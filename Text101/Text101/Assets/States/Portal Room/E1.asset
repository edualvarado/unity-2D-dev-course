  storyText: "You can\xB4t believe it. The source battery of your temporal communicator
    is exhausted, probably because of your previous contact with the base.\r\n\r\nTo
    restore it, you need to use the last cumulus of light that you have left. However,
    you remember the portal has a damaged collector. It could be the case, where
    you may also need the last cumulus to repair it and to initiate the travel sequence,
    since both devices require the same source of energy.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do?\r\n\r\n1.
    Replace the battery of your temporal communicator with the last light cumulus
    and ask for help to the base.\r\r\n2. Just in case, save it for the portal and
    wait a little bit more."
