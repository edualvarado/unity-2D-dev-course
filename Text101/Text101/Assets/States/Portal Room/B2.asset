  storyText: 'You run away but it''s too late. The creatures, which at that moment
    appeared in the portal room, have already seen you hiding behind the platform,
    and are coming directly to you.


    Among your arsenal you have no ammunition,
    only a light grenade that could be used to distract them and head into the portal
    to fix it and make it run.


    What should I do?


    1. Rushing your time
    and throwing the grenade at the last moment. Then, run to the portal and fix
    it.

    2. Close your eyes, just as you were taught at the knight''s school
    during your training.'
