  storyText: "You'd rather not take any chances, so you wait a little bit more. The
    creatures seems to be gone, since you can not feel the strange presence anymore.
    \r\n\r\nSlowly you open your eyes, to contemplate the empty room, in which there
    are only remains of old machinery and cold steel. \r\n\r\nYou don't waste a second
    and head for the temporal gate to replace the broken collector. \r\n\r\nOnce
    it starts to run, beautiful lights that are transformed into multi-colored refractions
    start to emerge in the contour of the portal. With an agile jump, you jump to
    the light vortex, and travel to the base station, leaving that horrible world
    behind you. You WON!\n\nPress \"1\" to start again."
