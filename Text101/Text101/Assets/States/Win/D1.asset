  storyText: 'You''d rather not take any chances. You wait until you hear the portal
    finally open, as a complete portal emits a very particular sound. At that moment,
    you open your eyes and head into the tunnel of light, which is few steps away.


    The
    creatures don''t have time to reach you. In one short moment, an agile jump is
    enough to get you in the light vortex. You''re travelling to the base where your
    companions are waiting for you.


    The past is safe again, and the mission
    accomplished. You WON!


    Press "1" to start again.'
