  storyText: 'You throw the grenade. A flash of light floods the room. With one sharp
    movement, you head for the portal to turn it on. Unfortunately, the collector
    is damaged, and only the last cumulus of light could fix it. Luckily, you didn''t
    use it for your temporal communicator. You open the collector as fast as possible
    while the creatures are blinded, and change the cumulus. The portal opens fast
    enough to jump in the last moment, right before one of the creatures comes at
    you with supernatural speed. With a quick leg movement, you avoid his sharp and
    long claws, and enter the portal.


    The light tunnel carries you in time
    to the base, safety. You WON!


    Press "1" to start again.'
